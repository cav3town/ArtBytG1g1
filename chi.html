<p class="whitetext"> a sign so faded <br>
 it's hard to capture <br>
 what happened to you? <br>
 was it the rain? <br>
 was it the sun? <br>
 was it time? <br>
 with a title so iconic, <br>
 you should not be left to wither <br>
with a place so iconic, <br>
its ironic <br>
and yet... <br>
maybe a place like you needs no sign </p>
